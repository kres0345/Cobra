Cobra is a brilliant project. It is made to assemble different functions into a single program.

About the creator: The CobraConsole project is a project started by me(obviously) I am 15 years old, and I love computers. 
I created Cobra for training with PATH and because I think it's pretty cool. My other alias is Nett18.
