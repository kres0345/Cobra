# Cobra
Cobra is a console like python or windows cmd. You can download additions with Cobra, so it gets more functions after your taste. 

### Development progress
I haven't planned on beginning working on this project again anytime soon. But if you're interested then take look at [CMDExtension](https://github.com/kres0345/CMDextension).

### Installation

You can download & install the program by download [install.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kres0345/CobraConsole/master/install.bat), no need to download whole repository(even though you could) :-D

### Cobra Extensions/Dependencies
Cobra Dependencies is additions you can download with Cobra and run from Cobra.
Examples of dependencies are TextEditor and FakeUpdate.

##### Submitting
You can submit a package [here](https://github.com/kres0345/CobraPackageSuggestions).
Then I will do the rest to make it work with Cobra (e.g. Title, Proper startup, Exit).
You can also just submit an idea you have for an extension.
